# Simplex Algorithm

## About the Project
This project implements the Simplex algorithm, a widely used method for solving linear programming problems. Linear programming involves optimizing a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear inequality constraints. The Simplex algorithm iteratively improves the solution until an optimal solution is reached.

## Run
